# Overview
This repository contains three C programs: fib.c, hyp.c, and scanf.c, each addressing a different computational task.

## fib.c
* This program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms. It uses a function to calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence by updating the current and previous terms. User input is validated to ensure a positive integer is provided, and the sequence is displayed in a comma-separated format.

## hyp.c
* This program approximates the inverse hyperbolic tangent (arctanh(x)) using two methods: a Maclaurin series expansion and a logarithmic formula. The user specifies a precision value to control the accuracy of the Maclaurin method. It calculates arctanh(x) for values between -0.9 and 0.9, compares the results of both methods, and outputs their differences for each step.

## scanf.c
* It prompts the user to enter an integer and a floating-point number. The program verifies the validity of the input and prints the results or displays an error message if the input is invalid.
