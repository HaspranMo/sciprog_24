## Overview
This project consists of magic_square.h and main.c, that work together to determine whether a given square matrix is a magic square.  A magic square is a matrix where the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

# magic_square.h:

Implements the isMagicSquare function to check if the matrix satisfies the magic square properties.

# main.c:

* Reads the matrix size and elements from a file.
* Dynamically allocates memory for the matrix.
* Calls isMagicSquare to validate the matrix.
* And prints whether the matrix is a magic square.
