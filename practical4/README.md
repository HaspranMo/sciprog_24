# Overview
This program calculates the integral of the function tan(x) over the range [0, 60] using the Trapezoidal Rule. It approximates the integral by dividing the interval into 12 points and summing the weighted values of the function.

# Details
* A custom function converts angles from degrees to radians for tan() function.
* The program computes tan(x) for each angle (every 5 degrees) .
* The other function applies the Trapezoidal Rule, summing contributions from all points to approximate the integral.
