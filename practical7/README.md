# Overview
This project consists of two C programs, e.c and pointers.c

## e.c
This program estimates the value of e using the series expansion of f(x). The program dynamically allocates memory to store the terms of the series. Each term is calculated using a factorial function and summed to approximate e. The estimated value is compared with the actual value.

## pointers.c
This program demonstrates basic dynamic memory allocation and array handling in C. It includes functions to allocate an array, fill it with ones, print its contents, and free the allocated memory.
