##  Program Description:
 * This program computes the integral of the function f(x) = tan(x) over the range [0, Ï€/3] using the Trapezoidal Rule.
 * It approximates the integral as a summation and compares the result with the exact value log(2).

# Details:
    It divides the interval into 12 points, computes the sum of the function values, and applies the formula to approximate the integral. The program compares the computed result with the exact value (log(2)) and outputs the absolute and relative differences. All calculations are performed in radians
