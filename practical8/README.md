#  Overview
This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using both iterative and recursive methods, based on the Euclidean algorithm.

# Features
## Iterative Method:
Implements a while loop to find the GCD step by step.
## Recursive Method:
Uses recursion to compute the GCD with a base case for termination.

# Usage
The program prompts the user to enter two integers, calculates their GCD using both methods, and displays the results.
